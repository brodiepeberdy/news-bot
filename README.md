This bot uses Python 3, the [python-twitter library](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and the [requests library](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) in conjunction with [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/). The script is currently hosted using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and is periodically executed using [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/). Note that this script has been temporarily disabled, however the bot account still exists with a healthy history of posts made.
